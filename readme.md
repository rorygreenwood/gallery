A project that will hook up to a screen and cycle through pictures.
The pictures will originally be found locally on a file, but the plan
is to have a connection to a remote server.

To access images, each one will have a corresponding record saved in a database.
Details will also include the ratio of the picture, and thematic info (artist, time, portrait/landscape, etc)
